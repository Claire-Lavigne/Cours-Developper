- Add a site map = a map of all the pages on your website you want indexed (added to appear in search engine results) :
  - if site made by developer : create a sitemap that updates automatically

# Analyse website
## A good website --> Good Google ranking
- efficient and optimized
- easy and intuitive design
- faster responsive version
- light pages

## Detect site issues
- Check that searches of the brand name return the website
- Check if the website has a primary address (with or without "www" => with "www" redirect to without “www”)
- [Check for duplicate content / plagia](http://www.siteliner.com/)
- Check for indexing or crawling issues :
  - tap “site: mysite.com,” in Google search bar, and look through the results
    - the website should appears. If not, search issues in : 
      - robots.txt file (allow access to search engines)
      - meta robots
      - website’s architecture
- Check if the website loads relatively quickly
  - if loads in more than 4s = slow (visitors leave + possible indexing problems)
  - mesure load speed : [GTmetrics](https://gtmetrix.com/) or [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com/)
- Check if the website is responsive

## Analyse SEO
- From Homepage : 
  - there are two secondary pages accessible through the menu + a blog article
  - the URLs are comprehensible and include the subject of the page (https://mysite.com/primary-keyword)
  - open the console in your browser (F12 in Google Chrome) and use CTRL+F to search for the information :
    - Meta tags "title" + "description" indicate the topic of the page to search engines and target keyword
      - They appear in the results and make visitors want to click and read the page
      - Title: 70 characters.
      - Description: Google displays between 132 and 160 characters, but write a little more
    - Meta tag "Robots" : set to “index, follow.”
    - Titles : only one h1 in page containing keyword, multiple h2 containing the keyword or a synonym
    - Images : small size, size adapted to final size, let the code adapt the size automatically, "alt" tags completed
- Content length in each page :
  - min 400 words for pages on your website (when it makes sense)
  - 600 words for blog posts, news or expert content

## Examine keyword rankings
- After having Google Analytics for 1 month : 
  - Check that the organic traffic on your website is increasing, or at least stable
    - Menu => “Acquisition” => “All Traffic” => “Channel” => “Organic Search”
- Get results from Google Search Console installed + Check issues again
  - Figure out which keywords are driving your website traffic before making any SEO changes

## Check the quality of existing links
- Check if social media accounts have been created and linked to the website = share and distribute the website content
- Make partnerships
- Use the Search Console (or Majestic, SEMRush, Moz Explorer...) and study the existing links
- Make sure that a majority of your traffic does not originate from spammy links (low-quality, foreign language websites, content completely different from yours)
